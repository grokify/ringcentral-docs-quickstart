# Answering Rules

Answering Rules enable users to control how calls are handled when their extension is called. Users can set which phone numbers are called, in which order and after what delay, as well as configure Ring Groups.

Answering rules are handled by the `account/~/extension/~/answering-rule` endpoint and associate rules with phone numbers handled by the user's forwarding number endpoint. Each user has 2 default answering rules for business hours and after hours, known as `business-hours-rule` and `after-hours-rule`, as well as custom rules.

| API | path |

| Answering Rule Endpoint for Business Hours Rule | `v1.0/account/~/extension/~/answering-rule/business-hours-rule` |
| Answering Rule Endpoint for After Hours Rule | `v1.0/account/~/extension/~/answering-rule/after-hours-rule` |
